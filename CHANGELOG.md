## [0.17.0] - 2023-06-12

Yanked. We recently renamed the project from asyncio-mqtt to aiomqtt. Problem is that the _old_ aiomqtt (by mossblaser) was still in use. These users suddenly experienced a breaking change when they updated from v0.1.2 to v0.17.0. Our mitigation is to yank v0.17.0 and release a v1.0.0 in it's place. It was about time for a v1.0.0 release anyhow!

- Add `clean_session` argument to `Client`
  Contributed by [@nadyka](https://github.com/madnadyka) in [#17](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/pull/17)

## [0.7.0] - 2020-08-04

I've tested the library for production use at SBT Instruments.
This uncovered a bunch of bugs and missing features that I've adressed
in this release. We are approaching a 1.0.0 release. Let me know
if you want something changed before that via the issue tracker on GitHub.

### Added

- Add support for MQTTv5.
- Add `will` keyword argument to `Client`.
- Add `MqttConnectError` with specific error messages for connection failures.
- Add `Client.id` property that returns the client ID (or `None` if
  the client ID was not specified during construction).

### Fixed

- Fix unhandled exception error.
- Fix "Task was destroyed but it is pending" error.
- Fix compatibility with `asyncqt`'s event loop.
- Fix race condition in `Client.connect` that raised an `AttributeError`.
- Fix "[asyncio] Future exception was never retrieved" debug message.
- Fix support for python 3.6.
  Contributed by [Derrick Lyndon Pallas (@pallas)](https://github.com/pallas) in [#12](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/pull/12)

## [0.6.0] - 2020-06-26

### Changed

- No longer logs exception in `Client.__aexit__`. It's perfectly valid
  to exit due to, e.g., `asyncio.CancelledError` so let's not treat it as an
  error.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-06-08

### Added

- Add support for python 3.6.
  Contributed by [Derrick Lyndon Pallas (@pallas)](https://github.com/pallas) in [#7](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/pull/7) (1/2).
- Add `client_id` and `tls_context` keyword arguments to the `Client` constructor.
  Contributed by [Derrick Lyndon Pallas (@pallas)](https://github.com/pallas) in [#7](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/pull/7) (2/2).
- Add `timeout` keyword argument to both `Client.connect` and `Client.disconnect`. Default value of `10` seconds (like the other functions).

### Changed

- Propagate disconnection errors to subscribers. This enables user code to detect if a disconnect occurs. E.g., due to network errors.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-05-06

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Forward the [MQTTMessage](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python/blob/1eec03edf39128e461e6729694cf5d7c1959e5e4/src/paho/mqtt/client.py#L355)
  class from paho-mqtt instead of just the `payload`. This applies to both
  `Client.filtered_messages` and `Client.unfiltered_messages`.

  This way, user code not only gets the message `payload` but also the `topic`, `qos` level, `retain` flag, etc.

  Contributed by [Matthew Bradbury (@MBradbury)](https://github.com/MBradbury) in [#3](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/pull/3).

## [0.3.0] - 2020-04-13

### Added

- Add `username` and `password` keyword arguments to the `Client` constructor.
  Contributed by [@gluap](https://github.com/gluap) in [#1](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/pull/1).

### Fixed

- Fix log message context for `Client.filtered_messages`.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-04-07

### Fixed

- Fix regression with the `Client._wait_for` helper method introduced in the latest
  release.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-07

### Changed

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Replace all uses of `asyncio.TimeoutError` with `MqttError`.

  Calls to `Client.subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`publish` will no longer raise `asyncio.TimeoutError.`

  The new behaviour makes it easier to reason about, which exceptions the library
  throws:

  - Wrong input parameters? Raise `ValueError`.
  - Network or protocol failures? `MqttError`.
  - Broken library state? `RuntimeError`.

## [0.1.3] - 2020-04-07

### Fixed

- Fix how keyword arguments are forwarded in `Client.publish` and `Client.subscribe`.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-04-06

### Fixed

- Remove log call that was erroneously put in while debugging the latest release.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-04-06

### Fixed

- Add missing parameters to `Client.publish`.
- Fix error in `Client.publish` when paho-mqtt publishes immediately.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-04-06

Initial release.
