# MQTT client with idiomatic asyncio interface üôå

Write code like this:


##### Subscriber
```python
async with Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
    async with client.filtered_messages("floors/+/humidity") as messages:
        await client.subscribe("floors/#")
        async for message in messages:
            print(message.payload.decode())
```

##### Publisher
```python
async with Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
    message = "10%"
    await client.publish(
            "floors/bed_room/humidity",
             payload=message.encode()
          )
```



asyncio-mqtt combines the stability of the time-proven [paho-mqtt](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) library with a modern, asyncio-based interface.

* No more callbacks! üëç
* No more return codes (welcome to the `MqttError`)
* Graceful disconnection (forget about `on_unsubscribe`, `on_disconnect`, etc.)
* Compatible with `async` code
* Fully type-hinted
* Did we mention no more callbacks?

The whole thing is less than [700 lines of code](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/blob/master/asyncio_mqtt/client.py).

## Installation üìö

`pip install asyncio-mqtt`

## Advanced use ‚ö°

Let's make the example from before more interesting:

```python
import asyncio
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack, asynccontextmanager
from random import randrange
from asyncio_mqtt import Client, MqttError


async def advanced_example():
    # We üíõ context managers. Let's create a stack to help
    # us manage them.
    async with AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        # Keep track of the asyncio tasks that we create, so that
        # we can cancel them on exit
        tasks = set()
        stack.push_async_callback(cancel_tasks, tasks)

        # Connect to the MQTT broker
        client = Client("test.mosquitto.org")
        await stack.enter_async_context(client)

        # You can create any number of topic filters
        topic_filters = (
            "floors/+/humidity",
            "floors/rooftop/#"
            # üëâ Try to add more filters!
        )
        for topic_filter in topic_filters:
            # Log all messages that matches the filter
            manager = client.filtered_messages(topic_filter)
            messages = await stack.enter_async_context(manager)
            template = f'[topic_filter="{topic_filter}"] {{}}'
            task = asyncio.create_task(log_messages(messages, template))
            tasks.add(task)

        # Messages that doesn't match a filter will get logged here
        messages = await stack.enter_async_context(client.unfiltered_messages())
        task = asyncio.create_task(log_messages(messages, "[unfiltered] {}"))
        tasks.add(task)

        # Subscribe to topic(s)
        # ü§î Note that we subscribe *after* starting the message
        # loggers. Otherwise, we may miss retained messages.
        await client.subscribe("floors/#")

        # Publish a random value to each of these topics
        topics = (
            "floors/basement/humidity",
            "floors/rooftop/humidity",
            "floors/rooftop/illuminance",
            # üëâ Try to add more topics!
        )
        task = asyncio.create_task(post_to_topics(client, topics))
        tasks.add(task)

        # Wait for everything to complete (or fail due to, e.g., network
        # errors)
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

async def post_to_topics(client, topics):
    while True:
        for topic in topics:
            message = randrange(100)
            print(f'[topic="{topic}"] Publishing message={message}')
            await client.publish(topic, message, qos=1)
            await asyncio.sleep(2)

async def log_messages(messages, template):
    async for message in messages:
        # ü§î Note that we assume that the message paylod is an
        # UTF8-encoded string (hence the `bytes.decode` call).
        print(template.format(message.payload.decode()))

async def cancel_tasks(tasks):
    for task in tasks:
        if task.done():
            continue
        try:
            task.cancel()
            await task
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            pass

async def main():
    # Run the advanced_example indefinitely. Reconnect automatically
    # if the connection is lost.
    reconnect_interval = 3  # [seconds]
    while True:
        try:
            await advanced_example()
        except MqttError as error:
            print(f'Error "{error}". Reconnecting in {reconnect_interval} seconds.')
        finally:
            await asyncio.sleep(reconnect_interval)


asyncio.run(main())
```
## TLS configuration for MQTT client

asyncio-mqtt also exposes paho-mqtt's `tls_set` functionality for the users. The following minimal example explains how to enable SSL/TLS support for asyncio-mqtt client

```python
import ssl
from asyncio_mqtt import Client, TLSParameters

"""
ca_certs          : a string path to the Certificate Authority certificate files
                    that are to be treated as trusted by this client
certfile & keyfile: strings pointing to the PEM encoded client certificate and 
                    private keys respectively
cert_reqs         : allows the certificate requirements that the client imposes on 
                    the broker to be changed. By default this is ssl.CERT_REQUIRED  
tls_version       : allows the version of the SSL/TLS protocol used to be specified. 
                    By default TLS v1 is used
ciphers           : string specifying which encryption ciphers are allowable for this 
                    connection, or None to use the defaults
keyfile_password  : if either certfile or keyfile is encrypted and needs a password to
                    decrypt it, then this can be passed using the keyfile_password
                    argument. If you do not provide keyfile_password, the password will
                    be requested to be typed in at a terminal window
"""
tls_params = TLSParameters(
    ca_certs="/path/to/certificates",
    certfile="/path/to/certfile",
    keyfile="/path/to/keyfile",
    cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED,
    tls_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv2,
    ciphers=None,
    keyfile_password=None,
)

async with Client(
    "test.mosquitto.org",
    username="username",
    password="password",
    protocol=ProtocolVersion.V31,
    tls_params=tls_params,
) as client:
    async with client.filtered_messages("floors/+/humidity") as messages:
        # subscribe is done afterwards so that we just start receiving messages
        # from this point on
        await client.subscribe("floors/#")
        async for message in messages:
            print(message.topic)
            print(json.loads(message.payload))
```

## Proxy settings for asyncio-mqtt client

asyncio-mqtt allows the user to configure proxing of MQTT connection and enables the support for SOCKS or HTTP proxies. asyncio-mqtt uses the paho-mqtt `proxy_set` functionality to allow setting up the proxy. One thing to note here is that setting up a proxy is an extra feature (even in paho-mqtt) that requires the `PySocks` dependency.

The following minimal example depicts how to configure proxing of the MQTT connection

```python
import socks
from asyncio_mqtt import Client, ProxySettings

proxy_params = ProxySettings(
    proxy_type=socks.HTTP,
    proxy_addr="example.com",
    proxy_rdns=True,
    proxy_username="username",
    proxy_password="password",
)

async with Client(
    "test.mosquitto.org",
    username="username",
    password="password",
    protocol=ProtocolVersion.V31,
    procxy=proxy_params,
) as client:
    ...
    ...
```

There is only a single dependency:

## Note for Windows Users

Since Python 3.8, the default asyncio event loop is the `ProactorEventLoop`. Said loop [doesn't support the `add_reader` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-platforms.html#windows) that is required by asyncio-mqtt. To use asyncio-mqtt, please switch to an event loop that supports the `add_reader` method such as the built-in `SelectorEventLoop`. E.g:
```python
# Change to the "Selector" event loop
asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
# Run your async application as usual
asyncio.run(main())
```
